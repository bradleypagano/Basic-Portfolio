        <p>Hello</p>
        <p>I was born in Decatur, GA.  Yes, I'm one of the few Atlanta natives.  I enjoy all kinds of things.  I hate writing about myself.  Maybe one day, I'll actually enjoy telling people about myself.  I doubt that day is today, though.  It's extremely difficult for me to wite anything.</p>
        <p>Actually, I think I would rather go through actual boot camp than spend 5 or 10 minutes writing about myself.  I'm really that bad at it. Can you tell?  I mean, I've only spent all of this time wrtitng about how bad I am at writing.  It must be sinking in by now.</p>
        <p>Oh yeah, I love Formula 1.  I could talk about Formula 1 forever. Ask me any question about the modern era of Formula 1 and I can come up with a well thought out answer.</p>
